To generate **clean, production-ready code with proper comments and error handling**, follow these core practices and guidelines synthesized from professional recommendations:

- **Write Readable, Organized Code**  
  - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names. Follow consistent **naming conventions** accepted in your language or team[2].
  - Organize code into manageable modules or components.
  - Avoid code duplication by applying the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle[2].
  - Structure projects clearlyâ€”use folders for logic, tests, config, and documentation[3].

- **Document Thoroughly and Precisely**  
  - Add **concise, meaningful comments** to explain non-obvious logic or business rules, not to repeat what the code already expresses[2].
  - Include docstrings for functions/classes describing inputs, outputs, purpose, and side effects.
  - Write a README and keep documentation up to date with code changes[3].

- **Handle Errors Robustly**
  - Use appropriate error/exception handling constructs for your language (e.g., try/except, try/catch)[2].
  - Provide meaningful error messages to aid debugging and user troubleshooting.
  - Avoid swallowing exceptions silently; log errors and consider how failures should propagate.
  - Validate inputs early and handle boundary/error cases explicitly.

- **Optimize for Production Readiness**
  - Avoid using beta toolsets or dependencies not suited for production[1].
  - **Compile in Release mode** (not Debug) for performance and security[1].
  - Ensure code builds cleanly with zero warnings[1].
  - Externalize configuration (credentials, settings) rather than hard-coding values. Use environment variables or secrets management solutions[5].
  - Use multiple instances for scalability and fault tolerance, especially for cloud or distributed deployments[5].
  - Automate testing and deployment via a CI/CD pipeline; enforce build, linting, and testing steps before release[1][3].

- **Additional Best Practices**
  - Prefer **immutable, constant values** where appropriate to reduce bugs (e.g., use global const instead of magic strings)[1].
  - Use fixed-size structures or buffers when appropriate; avoid unnecessary dynamic memory if you can control RAM usage precisely[1].
  - Maintain a version control history of all code and configuration for traceability and rollback[2][3][5].
  - Minimize privileges and protect sensitive credentials by using proper secrets management[5].

Here is a **generic production-ready code template example (Python):**

```python
import logging

# Set up logging for error tracking
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def divide_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Divide two numbers and return the result.
    Raises ValueError if b is zero.

    Args:
        a (float): Numerator
        b (float): Denominator

    Returns:
        float: Result of division
    """
    if b == 0:
        logging.error("Denominator 'b' cannot be zero.")
        raise ValueError("Denominator cannot be zero.")
    result = a / b
    logging.info("Division successful: %s / %s = %s", a, b, result)
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter numerator: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter denominator: "))
        print(f"Result: {divide_numbers(num1, num2)}")
    except ValueError as err:
        print(f"Input error: {err}")
    except Exception as ex:
        logging.critical("Unhandled exception: %s", ex)
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
```

- This code uses **clear documentation**, **error handling**, **logging**, and clean structure as required for production scenarios[2][3].
- For other languages or more complex applications, ensure analogous concepts and patterns are followed.

Following these principles makes your code **clean**, **maintainable**, and **robust for production deployment**[1][2][3][5].
