To generate **clean, production-ready code** with thorough comments and robust error handling, follow these foundational principles and practices:

- **Clean Code Fundamentals**:
  - Use consistent and descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes[2].
  - Organize code logically; group related functions and utilize modular structures or components[5].
  - Adhere to the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles for maintainability and scalability[2][5].
  - Format code consistently (indentation, spacing, line lengths) to improve readability[2].

- **Documentation and Commenting**:
  - Write meaningful comments that explain *why* complex or non-obvious code exists, not just *what* it does[2].
  - Use clear docstrings for all public functions, detailing arguments, return values, and exceptions.
  - Avoid redundant comments—ensure the code is self-explanatory where possible[2].

- **Robust Error Handling**:
  - Use structured error handling (e.g., try/catch or try/except blocks) to handle exceptions gracefully rather than letting the program crash[2].
  - Log errors with sufficient detail to facilitate debugging while avoiding sensitive data exposure.
  - Return meaningful error messages to users or calling functions, not generic error codes or silent failures[2].

- **Production-Readiness Checklist**:
  - Remove all debugging and temporary code.
  - Eliminate all compiler or linter warnings—adopt a zero-warnings policy during builds[1].
  - Compile and test your application in **Release mode** to ensure full optimization and correctness prior to deployment[1].
  - Prefer immutable data and define fixed global constants where practical[1].
  - Avoid unnecessary dynamic memory allocations to reduce leaks and improve performance[1].
  - Use version control effectively, keeping a stable main branch and integrating changes through proper code review[2][3].
  - Set up automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for reliability[1][3].

**Example: Python Production-Ready Function**

```python
import logging

def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Safely divide two numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): Numerator.
        b (float): Denominator.

    Returns:
        float: Result of division.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `b` is zero.
    """
    try:
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Denominator cannot be zero.")
        return a / b
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error dividing {a} by {b}: {str(e)}")
        # Raise a user-friendly error without leaking internal details
        raise

# Usage:
try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ValueError as ve:
    print(f"Input error: {ve}")
```
This code includes:

- **Type hints and docstrings** (for clear usage documentation)
- **Validation** (checking for zero denominator)
- **Error handling** (with user-friendly error messages and logging)
- **Logging** best practices (no sensitive information)

For production environments, always ensure:

- Consistent **testing** (prefer automated unit and integration tests)[3].
- **Build and release** in optimized mode, addressing all warnings and errors before deployment[1].
- Use **CI/CD pipelines** to catch issues early and enforce code quality standards[1][3].

These steps, combined with a strong focus on code clarity, documentation, and error resilience, ensure your codebase is robust and **production-ready**.
