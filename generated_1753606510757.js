To generate clean, production-ready code with proper comments and error handling, follow these core principles and best practices:

**1. Clean, Readable Structure**
- Use **meaningful and consistent naming conventions** for variables, functions, and classes to make code understandable by anyone reading or maintaining it[2].
- Organize code into clear, logical modules or functions with a single responsibility per module for better maintainability and scalability[5].

**2. Proper Commenting and Documentation**
- Write **concise, relevant comments** only where necessaryâ€”for explaining intent, complex logic, and important caveats. Avoid redundant comments that repeat what the code already states[2].
- Start with a module or function docstring describing its purpose, arguments, return values, and possible exceptions.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation, especially of public APIs and configuration.

**3. Robust Error Handling**
- Always handle potential errors using structured exception handling (try/catch or language equivalent)[2].
- Log errors with sufficient detail for debugging, but avoid exposing sensitive information[2].
- Where appropriate, fail gracefully without crashing the entire application (for example, return error codes or messages to the caller).
- Validate all external input and provide meaningful error responses.

**4. Production-Ready Practices**
- Remove unused or debugging code (such as print statements and test stubs) prior to deployment[1].
- Compile and test in Release mode, not Debug mode, to ensure performance and the absence of debugging dependencies[1].
- Write automated tests for core logic to minimize regressions[2].
- Use version control and CI/CD pipelines for deployment and updates[1].
- Apply a zero-warnings policy: resolve all compiler or linter warnings before releasing[1].

**5. Example (Python)**
```python
import logging

def divide(a, b):
    """
    Divides a by b.

    Args:
        a (float): Numerator.
        b (float): Denominator.

    Returns:
        float: Result of division.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If b is zero.
    """
    if b == 0:
        logging.error("Attempted division by zero: a=%s, b=%s", a, b)
        raise ValueError("Denominator cannot be zero.")

    result = a / b
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        num = 10
        denom = 0
        print(divide(num, denom))
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```
This code includes:
- **Clear docstring and comments.**
- **Proper error checking (zero division).**
- **Logging of the error with contextual details.**
- **Graceful error reporting to users.**

**6. Continuous Improvement**
- Refactor regularly: improve and simplify code without changing its functionality.
- Use linters to catch style issues and static code analysis tools to detect potential bugs[3].
- Solicit and incorporate peer code reviews[2].

Applying these standards will help ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and robust for production deployment[2][1][3][5].
