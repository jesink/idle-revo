To generate **clean, production-ready code with proper comments and error handling**, you should apply well-established best practices in software development. Production-ready code is more than just functional—it is maintainable, robust, clear, and reliable for live environments[5].

Key principles and a template example are provided below:

**Best Practices for Production-Ready Code:**

- **Readable and Understandable:** Use descriptive variable/function names, clear logic, and layout to make code easily understood by yourself and others[5][2].
- **Thorough Commenting:** Write concise comments to explain non-obvious parts, business logic, edge cases, and assumptions. Do not over-comment trivial code—focus on areas where context or intent needs clarification[2].
    - Use docstrings/comments to describe function purpose, parameters, return values, and errors.
- **Proper Error Handling:** Always handle potential errors gracefully. Use try/except (or equivalent) blocks to catch anticipated failures, and log errors with context. Avoid catching errors solely to suppress them; provide meaningful feedback and clean up resources[2].
- **Consistent Structure and Formatting:** Organize files, classes, and functions logically. Use consistent indentation, spacing, and styling[2][3].
- **Testing:** Include automated tests for critical code paths to ensure reliability[2][3].
- **Modularity:** Separate code into small, single-responsibility functions or classes to improve maintainability and testing[5].
- **No Residual Debug Code:** Remove debug prints or development-only checks and use the correct build mode (e.g., Release mode with optimizations)[1].
- **CI/CD Integration:** Ensure code passes build and test checks in a continuous integration pipeline[1][3].
- **Resource Management:** Avoid unnecessary resource usage. Always clean up resources (e.g., files, network connections)[1][5].

**Python Example: Clean, Production-Ready Code**

```python
import logging

# Set up basic logging - production code should use more elaborate config.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def divide(a, b):
    """
    Safely divides two numbers.

    Parameters:
        a (float): Numerator.
        b (float): Denominator.

    Returns:
        float: Division result.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If denominator is zero.
    """
    try:
        if b == 0:
            # Input validation to avoid ZeroDivisionError
            raise ValueError("Denominator cannot be zero.")
        result = a / b
        logging.info("Division successful: %s / %s = %s", a, b, result)
        return result
    except ValueError as ve:
        logging.error("ValueError: %s", ve)
        raise  # Re-raise so calling context can handle appropriately
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch-all for unexpected errors
        logging.exception("Unexpected exception occurred during division.")
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        res = divide(10, 0)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("Failed to perform division: %s", e)
```

**Key Takeaways:**

- The example shows **meaningful comments**, thorough **docstrings**, **structured error handling**, and **clean resource management**.
- Clean, production-ready code should be **modular, readable, well-documented, thoroughly tested, and robust against errors**[2][3][5].
- Production deployments require additional practices such as **using release builds, CI/CD pipelines, and strict code quality standards**[1][3][5].
